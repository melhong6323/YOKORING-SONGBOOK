(’ey) This is what you came for
Blood on the game ball
Everybody dropping like rainfall
(‘uh’) This is your moment
Eyes on the pulpit, kid
(I) think Church just opened

And they’re singing your praises la-la-la
Screaming your name out la-la-loud
One more step, you’re Immortal now, ‘cause

Once you play GOD
Once you play GOD
They’re gonna’ crumble one by one
Then we gonna ride right into the Sun like
it’s the day my kingdom come
Baby we’re

GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GODS
Yeah we’re
GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GODS

Welcome to the big show
Next on the ladder
Is it your name in the rafter?
Brief moment of silence
Bad girl woke up chose violence

And they’re singing my praises la-la-la
Screaming my name out la-la-loud
This is why we’re Immortal now, ‘cause

Once you play GOD
Once you play GOD
They’re gonna’ crumble one by one
Then we gonna ride right into the Sun 
like it’s the day my kingdom come
Baby we’re

GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GODS
Oh, yeah we’re
GA-GA-GA-GA-GA-GODS

I’m on my knees
Pray for glory
Will anyone read this underdog story?
I can’t lose myself again
Help me raise this heart
Heart, unbreakable

Once you play GOD
Once you play GOD
They’re gonna’ crumble one by one
Then we gonna ride right into the Sun
like it’s the day my kingdom come
Once you play GOD
Once you play GOD
They’re gonna’ crumble one by one
Then we gonna ride right into the Sun 
like it’s the day my kingdom come
Baby we’re
