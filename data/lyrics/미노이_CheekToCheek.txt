Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can 
hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing 
cheek to cheek

Ohh heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me 
through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing 
cheek to cheek

Oh I'd love to go out fishing 
in an ocean or a creek
But it wouldn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Ohh I'd love to climb a mountain 
and reach the highest peak
But it wouldn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Won't you come and dance with me
I want my arms about you 
the charms about you
Will carry me through to..

Heaven, I'm in heaven
The cares that hung 
around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together 
dancing cheek to cheek

Won't you come and dance with me
I want my arms about you 
the charms about you
Will carry me through to..

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung
around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together, 
When we're out together,
When we're out together dancing 
cheek to cheek
