I know you love a freak like me
I know you want a freak like me
I know you love a freak like me
I know you want a freak like me
Fast foreign ridah
Call me your highness
You talk shit then I mighta
Pull up to yo mama

든든해 with my bands on
Bling bling icy neck with a thong on
High up on the moon like 매번
Jet ski no company
Just the two of us
I keep hangin the phone
You kept takin my soul
Yeah I meant really no
But I know you want more

I know you want a freak like me
I know you love a freak like me
I know you want a freak like me
I know you love a freak like me
This shit so easy
After all the bullshit
I’ve been hangin side to side
We deserve a good massage

빨리 와서 take these off of me
I’ve been ready since I saw you just across the street
Yeah come outside
Put your d**k on me
Don’t you ever take your both hands off of me
Runnin round Paris 찍고 London
요새 가까워지고 있어 abundance
내게 갖고 있는 수많은 assumptions
I never hit reply but I see a lot of myself drunken
So I lie time to time
And I know why I can’t decide
너무 많아 고민들도
너무 많아 챙길 놈도
So I’m tired time to time
And I know why I can’t decide
계획에 없던 너를 만나고
You’re the first I never wanna let go

I know you want a freak like me
I know you love a freak like me
I know you want a freak like me
I know you love a freak like me
This shit so easy
After all the bullshit
I’ve been hangin side to side
We deserve a good massage

Swish swish swish fast like a jet ski
Do me wrong
I’ll pull up on your bestie
And you know your bitch nasty
Swish swish swish fast like a jet ski
Do me wrong
I’ll pull up on your bestie
And you know your bitch nasty
